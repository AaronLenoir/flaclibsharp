flaclibsharp
============

A .NET library for reading FLAC metadata.

It could do everything: read AND write metadata, encode and decode audio streams to and from FLAC, ... but it doesn't! Currently it only reads metadata.

For a more complete Flac Library in C# check out nflac on github! I made this one because back then I wasn't able to find a Native library that could read the FLAC metadata, which I needed.
